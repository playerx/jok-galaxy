Ondřej Žára, for starting create this game.


Roadmap:
--------
1. Add authorization with Jok Identity (http://jok.ge)
2. Add groups (green group, red group) and war between groups, not everyone alone.
3. Add raitings system for players
4. Aiming is too difficult, it needs to fix somehow (added: Q - velocity left, E - velocity right)
